-Copy the renamed file to "/system/etc/wifi" (Backup the original first) set permission to 644 (rw,r,r)
-Create empty file in "/vendor/firmware/" and name it "fw_bcmdhd.bin"

Everything should be working fine now, open Hijacker app and test it.
[Disconnect from all the network or turn your wifi off for Hijacker app to work]

Bugs:
-Your WiFi will sometimes restart itself (Phone restart will fix this)
-Others? I don't know you tell me.
